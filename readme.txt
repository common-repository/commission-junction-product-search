Our wpCJProductSearch plugin allows you to quickly and easily display products from your Commission Junction affiliate partners.

== Description ==

Our wpCJProductSearch plugin allows you to quickly and easily display products from your Commission Junction affiliate partners. Install the plugin and you can add products to your existing blog posts or pages just be entering a shortcode. If you are a Commission Junction Affiliate Partner, this plugin is for you!

This plugin creates a Commission Junction product listing within your posts or pages.  Requires PHP5.

Features:

* Uses your own CJ Key and CJ Web ID
* Easy to define configuration defaults. You can set site-wide
  defaults for any CJ parameters, or override any of these defaults on
  a per-post basis. Documentation for these params are included
  directly on the settings page.
* Completely configurable. You can use any of the settings that are
  allowed by the CJ REST API.
* Local file caching. Product results can be saved to cache files for
  faster lookup times.

== Installation ==

* Get the ZIP file from Cyber Sprocket
* Get your CJ Key, and CJ Web ID from Commission Junction
* Install the plugin using the zip file.
* Go to wpCJProductSearch in the Wordpress Settings menu.
* Enter your CJ Key and CJ Web ID and any other options you'd like to set.
* Additionally, you can create a 'cache' directory in the same
  directory as the plugin and make it writable to enable caching. The
  plugin will work fine without caching, but page loads will tend to
  be much slower.
